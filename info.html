    <hr>
    <p>Welcome to scioly.rocks! You may use this site to learn and practice your mineral identification skills on 21,474 images of minerals! </p>
    <h4>How do I use this site?</h4>
    <p>Simply go to the <a href="/">home page</a> and type the name of the mineral which you see in the displayed image. Then, either press the button on the page or enter on your keyboard An alert will pop up either congratulating you on your correct answer or telling you the right answer. Press enter again to to load the next image.
    <h4>Why should I use this instead of minerobo?</h4>
    <p>Admittedly, scioly.rocks and minerobo are quite similar. However, both have their respective strengths and weaknesses</p>
    <p>The largest issue with minerobo is its lack of images. Most minerals have less than 10 images per mineral on minerobo whereas there are on average 278 images per mineral on scioly.rocks. The lack of images on minerobo mean that you end up memorizing the images instead of learning to ID the minerals. Consequently, frequent users of minerobo can often ID nearly 100% of the images correctly while not actually knowing how to ID minerals correctly. In my personal experience, I've seen many people who can race through minerorobo with nearly perfect accuracy who struggle with IDing images not on the bot. On scioly.rocks, the more than a magnitude of difference means that you will rarely come across a duplicate image and can actually learn mineral ID instead of image memoroization
    <p>That being said, there are of course times to practice on minerobo. Ironicaly, there are no rocks on scioly.rocks! This site is for mineral ID, which, when used properly, can still be very helpful for rock ID. If someone would be interested in helping expand scioly.rocks to include rocks, reach out! In the mean time, minerobo might be what you're looking for if you want to practice rocks.</p>
    <h4>I'm here to study mineral ID for USESO. Where do I go?</h4>
    <p>Click <a href='/useso'>here</a> to practice mineral ID using the USESO rock and mineral list. 
    <p>Never heard of USESO? See <a href='https://www.useso.org'>here</a> for more info</p>
    <h4>I'm not getting alot of these IDs. Are other people?</h4>
    <p>There are many very challenging images! This will help you continually get better at IDing minerals. Most people get between 20-60% correct.  </p>
    <h4>I'd like to help and/or give feedback! How should I reach out?</h4>
    <p>Please contact me on discord @malachi9!</p>
